/**
 * This class permits calculations about prime numbers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class uses an implementation of the Eratosthenes Sieve
 * to get all the prime numbers less or equal than a given number.
 *  
 * <p>
 * This implementation is an improvement compared to {@link PrimeSieve2}
 * in the sense that it occupies 1/3 less memory than the previous one.
 * It handles numbers in the interval {@code [0,3*2^37-192)}
 * i.e. {@code [0,Integer.MAX_VALUE * Long.SIZE * 3)}.
 *  
 * <p>
 * This class keeps the bit-array used to compute the Eratosthenes Sieve
 * so if the requested prime number is very big this class needs and keeps
 * allocated a lot of memory. To tell if the required N is prime it needs
 * up to 2*N/3 bits (therefore up to N/12 bytes) of memory.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The limit of {@code 3*2^37-192} is based on the fact that the JVM does
 * not allow to allocate an array with a size greater than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE},
 * but the platform-specific limits can be more restrictive.
 *   
 * <p>
 * However, if the required N is too big you may run into a {@link java.lang.OutOfMemoryError},
 * for example finding all primes in the interval {@code [0,3*2^37-192)}, besides being
 * relatively time consuming, it requires {@code 16Gb} of memory.
 * You can use the method {@link PrimeSieve3#getMemoryOccupation(long)} to know the memory occupation
 * given the interval upper limit and you can use the method {@link PrimeSieve3#getComputableIntervalUpperLimit(long)}
 * to know the computable interval using the given amount of memory.
 * 
 * <p> 
 * Using the method {@link #clean()} the memory can be freed but all the
 * computed primes will be lost and need to be computed again.

		 * mask = 00000000-00010000-00000000-00000000
		 * The positions are 0-based so shifting position 20 means that the bit 1 is in the 21th position.
		 * 
		 * This operation is modular that means that shifting 33 positions
		 * is the same as shifting 1 position. We need a mask with all 1 and
		 * only one 0 in the requested position, but using directly such mask
		 * does't work because using
		 *   -2 = 11111111-11111111-11111111-11111110
		 * and shifting it by 20 positions we obtain
		 * mask = 11111111-11100000-00000000-00000000
		 * that is not what we need.
